						Ruby_on_Rails

1. Requirements :

ruby
the rails framework
a web server (node)
a database system (psql)

2. Installing rails 
$ sudo gem install rails

3. checking version
$ rails --version

4.Generators helps in making your development life easier by automating tasks and creating everything to start a new project.

stating a basic project (but keep in mind that don't use this command in a already .git repository because this command creates a git repository.)
$ rails new blog

5 . $ cd blog

6. Starting the rails server 

gr00t@Gr00t:~/Desktop/ruby_rails/blog$ bin/rails server

Error:
Webpacker configuration file not found /home/gr00t/Desktop/ruby_rails/blog/config/webpacker.yml. Please run rails webpacker:install Error: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /home/gr00t/Desktop/ruby_rails/blog/config/webpacker.yml (RuntimeError)

Tried running rails webpacker:install but didn't worked as it says install yarn, but i already had yarn 0.32+git version which wasn't the suited one had to upgrade itbetween yarn v1 or yarn v2.

so i tried the command :
$ which yarn
/usr/bin/yarn

it may be different in your case "Check it for yourself"

then i removed the directory from the system using 

$ sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/yarn (Carefully: as it can mess up your debian if command went wrong)

then install npm using 

$ sudo apt install npm

and then install yarn using npm

$ npm install -g yarn

and then run the command 

$ rails webpacker:install

and Chillzzz you can run your rails server using the command

gr00t@Gr00t:~/Desktop/ruby_rails/blog$ bin/rails server

7. "Hello World!"

create a route first it will send request to controller then the controller fetch the data from the model and pass the data to the view for presentation

To create a route edit the config/routes.rb file 
at the top of the Rails.application.routes.draw block:

Add this line 

get "/articles", to: "articles#index"

and now on the command line use this command to make a controller 

as We already defined the route, so use the param --skip-routes : 

$ bin/rails generate controller Articles index --skip-routes
